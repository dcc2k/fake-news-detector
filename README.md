## Overview

This project is an implementation of a Fake News Detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of the project is to identify and classify news articles as either genuine or fake based on their textual content. Fake news is a significant issue in today's information landscape, and this project aims to contribute to the efforts in combating misinformation and disinformation.

## Introduction

Fake news detection involves a multi-step process, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. In this project, we utilize state-of-the-art NLP techniques to build and train a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

## Installation

This project uses:

- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

You can also install them using poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

### Using Docker

This project provides a docker-compose.yml file to run the project in a docker container. To run the project in a docker container, follow the steps:

```bash
docker-compose up
``````
### Using Python

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd fake-news-detection
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the fake news detection process.

## Dataset

For this project, we used a publicly available dataset containing labeled news articles. You can find the dataset [here](https://example-dataset-link.com). The dataset contains both genuine and fake news articles, which is essential for training and evaluating the model.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in NLP. We performed the following preprocessing tasks:

- Tokenization
- Lowercasing
- Removing stop words
- Removing special characters and punctuation
- Lemmatization or stemming

## Feature Extraction

We used two main techniques for feature extraction:

1. Bag of Words (BoW): A simple technique that represents each article as a vector of word frequencies.
2. Word Embeddings: Word2Vec or other pre-trained word embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words.

## Model Training

We experimented with various machine learning models, including:

- Na√Øve Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- Deep Learning Models (e.g., LSTM, CNN)

We used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

We evaluated our models using standard NLP metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also used confusion matrices to analyze the model's performance.

## Results

Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. The model outperformed baseline models and demonstrated the effectiveness of NLP techniques in fake news detection.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements for this project:

- Incorporating more advanced deep learning architectures.
- Exploring ensemble methods to improve performance.
- Real-time fake news detection for social media or news websites.
- Building a user-friendly web application for easy access to the fake news detection system.
